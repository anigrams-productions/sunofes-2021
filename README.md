A simple game about how fun it can be to create stories with friends.

Play as a nerdy middle-school dungeon master trying to teach her excitable (and notably "normie") friends how to play a tabletop RPG.

The game is split into 5 themed encounters, each consisting of 5-7 randomized segments where the player must select a "card" to determine which dangerous situation to throw the party into next.
