# Lisa: The Nerdy One

![Lisa](Images/Lisa.png)

As an introvert, Lisa is generally known to be quiet and prefers to keep to herself. She enjoys reading books, watching anime, and playing videogames, especially RPGs. Jane and Christine are her best (and only) friends.

Speaks in short, simple sentences and prefers to get straight to the point. She shows little outward emotion, so when she smiles, it's a rare (and cute!) treat.
