# Christine: The Sporty One

![Christine](Images/Christine.png)

Christine is upbeat and energetic, and as a member of the school softball team, is the most athletic of the three girls. A bit of a goofball, she prefers to play games and have fun rather than study.

She can be loud and obnoxious at times, exclaiming and reacting with strong emotions to seemingly minor events.
