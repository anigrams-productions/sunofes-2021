# Attributes

## Allocation
Each character starts with some number of Attribute Points that can be allocated towards the three main attributes at the start of the game. 

The player may choose from three "levels" to determine how many points are allocated to that attribute.

### Levels
* Novice: low number (0-6) of Attribute points are allocated
* Average: medium number (7-13) of Attribute points are allocated
* Expert: high number (14+) of Attribute points are allocated


## Main Attributes
### Style
The measure of how fasionable, charming, and/or cool a character is.

Characters with high Style make dramatic entrances and often have flashy moves that can impress and/or intimidate opponents, and are less likely to run out of money.

### Magic
The measure of how well a character can wield magic and how powerful their magic is.

Characters with high Magic can cast powerful magic spells for both offense and defense, and are less likely to run out of mana.

### Wisdom
The measure of a character's intelligence and depth of knowledge.

Characters with high Wisdom are able to use wit, cunning, exposition, and/or strategy to get through hairy situations, and are less likely to run out of health.


## Modifiers

After all Attribute points have been allocated, each character will automatically choose a Strength and a Weakness.

If a character has a Strength in a particular attribute, they gain a +1 attribute modifier. This number is added on to the number of attribute points a character has allocated.

For example, if an action requires 14 Magic, but the character only has 13 Magic attribute points, normally they would fail the check. But if the character's strength is Magic, their total Magic attribute value is actually 13 + 1 = 14, which would pass the check.

If a character has a Weakness in a particular attribute, they will have a -1 attribute modifier. This number is _subtracted_ from the number of attribute points a character has allocated.

Using a similar example, if an action requires 14 Magic and the character has 14 Magic attribute points, normally they would pass the check. However, if the character's weakness is Magic, their total Magic attribute value is actually 14 - 1 = 13, which would fail the check.

Resource costs can also modified by a character's Strength. For example, a character whose strength is Magic will use less Mana while taking action, so if the Magic-based action costs 10 Mana, this particular character will only lose 10 - 1 = 9 Mana.


## Resources

These resource attributes are automatically allocated the same for everyone based on the values set in Advanced Settings.

### Health
The amount of damage a character can take before retreating.

If a character is forced to retreat because their Health reaches 0, they will be unable to participate for the rest of the encounter.

### Mana
Determines the amount of Magic-based actions a character can perform.

If a character runs out of Mana, they will no longer be able to perform Magic-based actions or any other actions that cost Mana.

### Money
The amount of currency a character has to spend on items of value.

If a character runs out of Money, they will no longer be able to perform actions that cost Money.
