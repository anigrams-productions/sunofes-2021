## Gameplay Structure

Each themed encounter consists of 5-7 segments with scenarios randomly chosen from a pool of 10-12 possible scenarios per theme.

Characters take turns selecting from 3 random scenarios at the beginning of each segment.
* Once a scenario has been selected, it can't appear as an option again.
* You can only control the main character's scenario selection. The other two characters will automatically select one when it's their turn, unless this option is turned off in Advanced Settings.

Each scenario represents a stop along the journey. The characters may encounter a new friend or foe, discover a new shop or location, find hidden treasure, or make some other discovery.

During the scenario, characters take turns taking actions that shape the course of the story.

Each character rolls one die for an "Initiative" check. The character with the highest roll gets to go first, then the second-highest roll, then the lowest roll. If two characters get the same high roll, they each roll again until the tie is broken.

During each character's turn, they are given a choice of three possible actions to take based off of the three Attributes.
* Actions may sometimes cost Money, Health, or Mana. Any cost will be specified with the action.
* Magic-based actions will always cost Mana. The amount of Mana required depends on how powerful the spell is.
* The cost of the action must be paid up-front if it's selected, regardless of whether the action succeeds or fails.
* You can only control the main character's action selection. The other two characters will automatically select one when it's their turn, unless this option is turned off in Advanced Settings.

For each action, the character must roll the dice to determine the minimum Attribute value needed to perform the action successfully.
* If the character's attribute value is equal to or higher than the amount rolled (including Attribute Modifiers), the action is performed successfully and the character is rewarded (with money, health, mana, other treasure/items, a special scenario and/or extra action, etc.).
* Otherwise, the action fails and the character is punished (and loses money, health, a turn, etc.)

Whether each action succeeds or fails determines which actions the next character can take.

Each segment/scenario only lasts long enough for all (active) characters to perform at least one action.
