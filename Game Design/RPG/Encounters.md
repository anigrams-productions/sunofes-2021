# Encounters

Each encounter has a unique theme, which includes a setting and story objective, and features:
* A setup section where the girls talk about real-life from the last week and discuss where they want to go next in the RPG
* The game-within-a-game RPG
* A resolution where the girls talk about what happened, share memorable moments, and discuss what they wish did or didn't happen
    * Tone depends on whether they succeeded in the story objective or failed because they all had to retreat (no game overs)
    * Keep track of secrets found, NPCs met, enemies faced, wins and losses, crazy high or low rolls that resulted in rare outcomes, etc.
