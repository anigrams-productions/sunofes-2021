# Encounters

Each encounter has a unique theme, which includes a setting and story objective, and features:
* A setup section where the trio talk about real-life from the last week and discuss where they want to go next in the RPG
* The game-within-a-game RPG
* A resolution where the trio talk about what happened, share memorable moments, and discuss what they wish did or didn't happen
    * Tone depends on whether they succeeded in the story objective or failed because they all had to retreat (no game overs)
    * Keep track of secrets found, NPCs met, enemies faced, wins and losses, crazy high or low rolls that resulted in rare outcomes, etc.

    * RPG Objective: NPC 3, a human turned training dummy, had a fight with his friend, NPC 1, before the curse struck and they were separated. NPC 3 asks the trio to find NPC 1 and make sure they're okay. When they find NPC 1 and tell him about NPC 3, the villain shows up. Despite all odds, NPC 1 risks everything to escape and find his friend, and they apologize and reconcile.

    * Act 2: Rising Movement
    * Goal: bonds of friendship strengthen
    * RPG Objective: NPC 3 asks you to venture deep into the volcano to recover something "priceless" (NPC 1) from the volcano before it erupts. The villain causes the volcano to erupt early and the trio have to hurry to recover NPC 1. When they find NPC 1, they find out that NPC 1 is NPC 3's estranged daughter.
    * Real-life: summer heat wave is making the trio miserable, Christine wanted to go buy a new videogame that came out but it's too hot to go out and get it

    * Goal: energy is reversed, the trio starts to come apart
    * RPG Objective: NPC 3 says he came to the desert to hunt down the monster who took his arm (NPC 1), but he can't go on and asks the trio to hunt down the monster in his stead. The villain steals the trio' water, leaving them stranded in the hot and dry desert, so they have to finish the journey and find NPC 1 despite getting more desperate and annoyed with each other. NPC 1 turns out to be NPC 3's girlfriend/wife who was turned into a monster, and NPC 1 was trying to rescue NPC 3 and carry him to safety, but her claw accidentally tore through his arm instead and he fell.
    * Real-life: heat wave is still in effect, trio wish they could go out and buy slushies to quench their thirst and cool off, but they don't have enough money

After finding NPC 1 (who used to be best friends with the villain) and learning more about the villain and his weakness, the trio face off against the villain (and his undead dragon steed) and defeat him
