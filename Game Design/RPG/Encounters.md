# Encounters

Each encounter has a unique theme, which includes a setting and story objective, and features:
* A setup section where the girls talk about real-life from the last week and discuss where they want to go next in the RPG
* The game-within-a-game RPG
* A resolution where the girls talk about what happened, share memorable moments, and discuss what they wish did or didn't happen
    * Tone depends on whether they succeeded in the story objective or failed because they all had to retreat (no game overs)
    * Keep track of secrets found, NPCs met, enemies faced, wins and losses, crazy high or low rolls that resulted in rare outcomes, etc.

## Summary of Encounters

    * day open.png
    * weekend - casual
    * Act 1: Introduction
    * Goal: introduce the characters, their RPG personas, the game mechanics, the villain, the idea of throwing a fancy party to celebrate if they make it all the way to the end
    * RPG Objective: NPC 3, a training dummy animated by NPC 1 after they escaped from danger, asks you to clear the area of monsters and investigate where they're coming from and why they've suddenly appeared - the girls find that the monsters are being sent by the villain
    * Real-life: girls were playing dodgeball in P.E. and Lisa got pummeled with dodgeballs that seemed to appear "out of nowhere"
* Since it's summer and it's super hot, the girls are inspired to do a volcano-themed encounter (with dragons)
    * bg_01.png (fiery mountains)
    * sunset closed.png
    * after school - uniform
    * Act 2: Rising Movement
    * Goal: bonds of friendship strengthen
    * RPG Objective: NPC 3 asks you to venture deep into the volcano to recover a piece of advanced technology (NPC 1) before it gets destroyed when the volcano erupts - the villain causes the volcano to erupt early and the girls have to escape within some number of turns
    * Real-life: summer heat wave is making the girls miserable, Christine wanted to go buy a new videogame that came out but it's too hot to go out and get it
* Desert-themed encounter where the girls must race to find water before they shrivel and die

    * sunset open.png
    * after school - uniform
    * Act 3: Climax
    * Goal: energy is reversed, the trio starts to come apart
    * RPG Objective: NPC 3 says he came to the desert to hunt down the monster who took his arm (NPC 1), but he can't go on and asks the girls to hunt down the monster in his stead - the villain steals the girls' water, leaving them stranded in the hot and dry desert, so they have to finish the journey and find NPC 1 within some number of turns
    * Real-life: heat wave is still in effect, girls wish they could go out and buy slushies to quench their thirst and cool off, but they don't have enough money
* After doing a volcano-themed one and feeling even _more_ hot, they decide to do an ice-themed encounter to cool off instead

    * Goal: lead up to moment of final suspense when the trio looks to be disbanded for good and hope seems lost
    * RPG Objective: NPC 3 asks you to find its master (NPC 1) who saw something and ran off, leaving NPC 3 behind - the villain was behind summoning the (boss) monster that caused NPC 1 to run off
    * Real-life: girls finally went to get their slushies, and Jane thought she saw one of their classmates, but the person ran off before Jane could talk to them

    * RPG Objective: NPC 3 says they used to serve the villain but doesn't want to anymore, and only NPC 1 knows how to break the curse that binds NPC 3 to the villain - after finding NPC 1 and learning more about the villain (and his weakness), the girls face off against the villain (and his undead dragon steed) and defeat him
