# Game World

Fantasy setting (more Zelda-like than Tokien-esque?)
* Made up by middle-school girls, so it incorporates a lot of different "cool" things that may or may not make sense together
* Realism doesn't matter, inconsistencies are okay and part of the fun

Mythological?
* Pantheon of gods with family drama, often interfere in lives of normal folk
* Angels and demons (because they're cool)

Soft magic system - deep, ancient, unknowable

Fairies, fairytales - tricksters, can make deals with them, sometimes cause people to disappear and reappear randomly

Moon people? Like elves, but from the moon

Cats are special and magical and can talk

Dark lord/big bad is killing everyone and stealing their souls to awaken/become something even worse
