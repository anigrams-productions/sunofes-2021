# Overall Story

Lisa's mom got promoted at work and now her family is planning to move across the country at the end of the summer.

Before she leaves, as a "last hurrah" before the end of the summer, Lisa wants to play a tabletop RPG she's been planning with her friends. She wants to spend as much time with them as she can since she may never see them again, and the other girls want to do the same.

The plot of the game-within-a-game should involve some evil force trying to force the three friends apart and them overcoming all odds through the power of friendship, in the end vowing to stay together as "The Twinkling Trio" no matter what.

This, of course, translates into real life, with the three girls promising to stay in touch and play this game together again someday.

Each of the game-within-a-game encounters should relate to something that's happening or has happened with one or more of the girls in real-life. Since these can be any random everyday occurrence, it may be better to plan the game-within-a-game story first and write the meta story for each encounter around what's expected to happen within the RPG portion.
