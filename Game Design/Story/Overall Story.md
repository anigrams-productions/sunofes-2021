# Overall Story

Lisa's mom got promoted at work and now her family is planning to move across the country at the end of the summer.

Before she leaves, as a "last hurrah" before the end of the summer, Lisa wants to play a tabletop RPG she's been planning with her friends. She wants to spend as much time with them as she can since she may never see them again, and the other girls want to do the same.

The plot of the game-within-a-game should involve some evil force trying to force the three friends apart and them overcoming all odds through the power of friendship, in the end vowing to stay together as "The Twinkling Trio" no matter what.

This, of course, translates into real life, with the three girls promising to stay in touch and play this game together again someday.

Each of the game-within-a-game encounters should relate to something that's happening or has happened with one or more of the girls in real-life. Since these can be any random everyday occurrence, it may be better to plan the game-within-a-game story first and write the meta story for each encounter around what's expected to happen within the RPG portion.

## Conflict

About halfway through the story, Jane and Christine start fighting. Jane is getting really invested in the game and keeps trying to tell the other characters how they should play, which Christine doesn't like because she just wants to have fun and doesn't care how realistic it is. Christine thinks Jane tries too hard to be perfect at everything, and Jane thinks Christine is too laid back and doesn't put in enough effort.

The conflict comes to a head when Christine "screws something up" by purposely refusing to listen to Jane, which makes Jane furious. She says, "If you're going to be like that, I don't want to play with you anymore," but Christine insists that it doesn't matter what she does anyway because it's just a dumb game. Lisa tries to ask everyone to calm down and get along, but Jane and Christine ignore her, continuing to exchange insults and harsh words until they both storm out angrily, leaving Lisa alone and wondering if they'll be able to finish the game.

Lisa half-heartedly begins the final encounter on her own, wishing her friends were there with her and feeling immensely lonely. Without the other girls' powers, Lisa has a hard time. Just when it seems all hope is lost, Jane's and Christine's characters jump in and apologize to Lisa for being late, explaining that they wouldn't let some petty argument ruin their friendship and break up the trio. Jane and Christine agree to compromise and let each girl play the way they want to as long as they act for the good of the group (and/or the world).
