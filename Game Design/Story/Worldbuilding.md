# Worldbuilding

Fantasy setting (more Zelda-like than Tokien-esque?)
* Made up by middle-school girls, so it incorporates a lot of different "cool" things that may or may not make sense together
* Realism doesn't matter, inconsistencies are okay and part of the fun

Mythological?
* Pantheon of gods with family drama, often interfere in lives of normal folk
* Angels and demons (because they're cool)

Soft magic system - deep, ancient, unknowable

Fairies, fairytales - tricksters, can make deals with them, sometimes cause people to disappear and reappear randomly

Moon people? Like elves, but from the moon

Cats are special and magical and can talk

Dark Lord is turning people (humans?) into animals/monsters, and it's up to The Twinkling Trio (T3) to break the curse and save them
* The other knights serve him
* The humans-turned-monsters are understandably upset and distrusting of outsiders because of what the Dark Lord did to them
* Break the curse with the power of friendship? Either by making friends with the villain, or by combining the power of all three of the Trio to banish the Dark Lord to another realm

Most of the monsters can be "defeated" peacefully by making friends with them depending on the actions you take

## Questions
Creation myth?

Sun fairies vs. moon people? How did they come to be on this planet?

Monster society? Human society?

Why are all the knights evil?
* They serve the Dark Lord - they're all part of the same Order?

Who is the Dark Lord and what does he want?
* He wants to turn all humans into monsters
* He takes the humans' souls/hearts when they turn into monsters, which makes him more powerful - the more enemies you defeat by killing instead of making friends with them, the stronger the Dark Lord becomes

Who/what are the gods in this world?

Backstory of The Twinkling Trio?
* At the start of the game, since only humans are affected by the curse, Endaleus in their infinite wisdom seeks out emissaries from the moon sorcerers and the sun fairies to help them investigate the cause of the curse and figure out how to break it
